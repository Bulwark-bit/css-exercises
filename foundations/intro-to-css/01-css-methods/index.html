    <!--I noticed here, on the solutions page. It can also be written as "<button style="-">" I figure that I there is a distinction between these. Probably that replacing "div" with the "button" selector, is more streamlined. So, in the future, it'd be good for me to remember I can just use the pre-wrote/planned selector.-->
      <!--I wonder also, if it would work the same as with anything else in this document. like the "p" value. if i needed to put some in-line style within it; could I just write: "<p style=color:white;etc->" Instead of closing the "p" <> and creating a seperate pair of <div> or other selector <>.?-->
